## DlxLib (C#)

DlxLib is an implementation of Dancing Links (DLX) as described in the following paper: 

[Dancing Links (Donald E. Knuth, Stanford University)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047v1.pdf "Dancing Links (Donald E. Knuth, Stanford University)")

Given a matrix of 1's and 0's, it finds all solutions where a solution identifies a subset of the rows in the matrix such that every column contains exactly one 1. This is known as the "exact cover" problem. It can be used to solve various puzzles.
